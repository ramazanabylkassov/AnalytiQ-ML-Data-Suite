# Data Analysis and Machine Learning Toolkit

## Introduction

Welcome to the Data Analysis and Machine Learning Toolkit! This program is designed to simplify the process of working with datasets that have a target feature, whether it's numeric or categorical. With this toolkit, you can perform various data pre-processing tasks, conduct data analysis with visualization, handle outlier analysis, and implement supervised machine learning models for both regression and classification tasks.

## Features

1. **Homepage - Data Pre-processing:**
  - Select and drop unnecessary columns from the dataset.
  - Impute missing values based on a predetermined strategy or remove rows with missing data if necessary.
  - Apply ordinal encoding to categorical features with an inherent order.
  - Utilize one-hot encoding for categorical features without a natural order.
  - Identify and drop duplicate rows, if any, to ensure data integrity.
  - Manually define the feature types, including the target variable, numerical features, and categorical features.

2. **Data understanding - Data Analysis and Visualization:**
  - Generate descriptive statistics for your dataset.
  - Visualize data distributions, correlations, and more.
  - Explore the relationship between features and the target variable.   
  - Identify and visualize outliers.

3. **Data understanding - Outlier Analysis:**
  - Detect and visualize outliers using various methods such as Z-score, IQR, or visualization techniques like scatter plots and box plots.

4. **Data Processing:**
  - Choose to treat outliers based on your analysis.
  - Prepare the data for machine learning models.
  - Perform any required normalization or standardization of numerical features.

5. **Model construction - Supervised Machine Learning:**
  - Split the dataset into training and testing subsets for further analysis and modeling.
  - Implement regression models for numeric target features.
  - Implement classification models for categorical target features.
  - Fine-tune model hyperparameters.
  - Evaluate model performance using various metrics.

## Usage

1. **Installation:**
   - Clone this repository or download the toolkit.
   - Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - Load your dataset (in CSV format).
   - Use the provided functions for data pre-processing to clean and prepare the data.

3. **Data Analysis and Visualization:**
   - Use the visualization functions to explore your data.
   - Identify and visualize outliers.

4. **Data Processing:**
   - Apply feature selection, data engineering as needed.

5. **Supervised Machine Learning:**
   - Choose a regression or classification model from the toolkit.
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters if necessary.
   - Train and evaluate the model on your dataset.

6. **Results and Reporting:**
   - Analyze the model's performance using the provided evaluation metrics.
   - Generate visualizations and reports to communicate your findings.
